Algo transfers is a higher-order use case capability provided by AlgoKit Utils allows you to easily initiate
algo transfers between accounts, including dispenser management and idempotent account funding.

## Transferring Algos

The key function to facilitate Algo transfers is `algokit.transfer(algod_client, transfer_parameters)`, which
returns the underlying `EnsureFundedResponse` and takes a `TransferParameters`

The following fields on `TransferParameters` are required to transfer ALGOs:

- `from_account`: The account or signer that will send the ALGOs
- `to_address`: The address of the account that will receive the ALGOs
- `micro_algos`: The amount of micro ALGOs to send

Example usage:

<Code code={transferAlgosExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

## Ensuring Minimum Algos

The ability to automatically fund an account to have a minimum amount of disposable ALGOs to spend is
incredibly useful for automation and deployment scripts. The function to facilitate this is
`ensure_funded(client, parameters)`, which takes an `EnsureBalanceParameters` instance and returns the
underlying `EnsureFundedResponse` if a payment was made, a string if the dispenser API was used, or `None`
otherwise.

The following fields on `EnsureBalanceParameters` are required to ensure minimum ALGOs:

- `account_to_fund`: The account address that will receive the ALGOs. This can be an `Account` instance, an
  `AccountTransactionSigner` instance, or a string.
- `min_spending_balance_micro_algos`: The minimum balance of micro ALGOs that the account should have
  available to spend (i.e. on top of minimum balance requirement).
- `min_funding_increment_micro_algos`: When issuing a funding amount, the minimum amount to transfer (avoids
  many small transfers if this gets called often on an active account). Default is 0.
- `funding_source`: The account (with private key) or signer that will send the ALGOs. If not set, it will use
  `get_dispenser_account`. This can be an `Account` instance, an `AccountTransactionSigner` instance,
  [`TestNetDispenserApiClient`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-py/blob/main/docs/source/capabilities/dispenser-client.md)
  instance, or None.
- `suggested_params`: (optional) Transaction parameters, an instance of `SuggestedParams`.
- `note`: (optional) The transaction note, default is "Funding account to meet minimum requirement".
- `fee_micro_algos`: (optional) The flat fee you want to pay, useful for covering extra fees in a transaction
  group or app call.
- `max_fee_micro_algos`: (optional) The maximum fee that you are happy to pay (default: unbounded). If this is
  set it's possible the transaction could get rejected during network congestion.

Example usage:

<Code code={ensureMinAlgosExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

The following occurs when making function calls Algod to find the current balance and minimum balance requirement:

- Gets the difference between those two numbers and checks to see if it's more than the `min_spending_balance_micro_algos`
- If so, it will send the difference, or the `min_funding_increment_micro_algos` if that is specified
- If the account is on TestNet and `use_dispenser_api` is True, the [AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/dispenser.md)
  will be used to fund the account.

<Aside>
  If you are attempting to fund via Dispenser API, make sure to set the
  `ALGOKIT_DISPENSER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable prior to invoking `ensure_funded`. To
  generate the token refer to [AlgoKit CLI
  documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/dispenser.md#login)
</Aside>

## Transferring Assets

The key function to facilitate asset transfers is `transfer_asset(algod_client, transfer_parameters)`, which
returns a `AssetTransferTxn` and takes a `TransferAssetParameters`:

The following fields on `TransferAssetParameters` are required to transfer assets:

- `from_account`: The account or signer that will send the ALGOs
- `to_address`: The address of the account that will receive the ALGOs
- `asset_id`: The asset id that will be transferred
- `amount`: The amount to send as the smallest divisible unit value

Example usage:

<Code code={transferAssetsExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

## Dispenser

If you want to programmatically send funds then you will often need a "dispenser" account that has a store of
ALGOs that can be sent and a private key available for that dispenser account.

There is a standard AlgoKit Utils function to get access to a [dispenser account](/algokit/utils/python/account):
`get_dispenser_account`. When running against
[LocalNet](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md), the
dispenser account can be automatically determined using the
[Kmd API](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/kmd). When running against other networks like TestNet
or MainNet the mnemonic of the dispenser account can be provided via environment variable `DISPENSER_MNEMONIC`

Please note that this does not refer to the [AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API](/algokit/utils/python/dispenser) which is a
separate abstraction that can be used to fund accounts on TestNet via dedicated API service.

Example usage:

<Code code={dispenserAccountExample} lang='py' frame='none' />
