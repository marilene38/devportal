# Overview

A set of core Algorand utilities written in TypeScript and released via npm that make it easier to build, test and deploy solutions on the Algorand Blockchain, including APIs, console apps and dApps. This project is part of [AlgoKit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli).

The goal of this library is to provide intuitive, productive utility functions that make it easier, quicker and safer to build applications on Algorand. Largely these functions provide a thin wrapper over the underlying Algorand SDK, but provide a higher level interface with sensible defaults and capabilities for common tasks that make development faster and easier.

:::note
If you prefer Python there's an equivalent [Python utility library](/build/algokit/utils/python/overview).

## Core principles

This library is designed with the following principles:

- **Modularity** - This library is a thin wrapper of modular building blocks over the Algorand SDK; the primitives from the underlying Algorand SDK are exposed and used wherever possible so you can opt-in to which parts of this library you want to use without having to use an all or nothing approach.
- **Type-safety** - This library provides strong TypeScript support with effort put into creating types that provide good type safety and intellisense.
- **Productivity** - This library is built to make solution developers highly productive; it has a number of mechanisms to make common code easier and terser to write

## Installation

This library can be installed from NPM using your favourite npm client:

```bash
npm install @algorandfoundation/algokit-utils
```

### Peer Dependencies

This library requires `algosdk` as a peer dependency. Ensure you have it installed in your project.

## Usage

To use this library simply include the following at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { AlgorandClient, Config } from '@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils';
```

As well as `AlgorandClient` and `Config`, you can use intellisense to auto-complete the various types that you can import withing the {} in your favourite Integrated Development Environment (IDE), or you can refer to the [reference documentation](/build/algokit/utils/ts/reference).

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning!">
  Previous versions of AlgoKit Utils encouraged you to include an import that looks like this (note the subtle difference of the extra `* as`):

    ```typescript
    import * as algokit from '@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils'
    ```

    This version will still work, but it exposes an older, function-based interface to the functionality that is in the process of being deprecated. The recommended way to use AlgoKit Utils is via the `AlgorandClient` class mentioned below, which is easier and more convenient to use. Some functionality won't yet be migrated to the new approach and this old approach will be needed, but the documentation pages will indicate when this is the case.

</Aside>

The main entrypoint to the bulk of the functionality is the `AlgorandClient` class, most of the time you can get started by typing `algokit.AlgorandClient.` and choosing one of the static initialisation methods to create an [Algorand client](/build/algokit/utils/ts/algorand-client), e.g.:

```typescript
// Point to the network configured through environment variables or
//  if no environment variables it will point to the default LocalNet
//  configuration
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.fromEnvironment();
// Point to default LocalNet configuration
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.defaultLocalNet();
// Point to TestNet using AlgoNode free tier
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.testNet();
// Point to MainNet using AlgoNode free tier
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.mainNet();
// Point to a pre-created algod client
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.fromClients({ algod });
// Point to pre-created algod, indexer and kmd clients
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.fromClients({ algod, indexer, kmd });
// Point to custom configuration for algod
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.fromConfig({ algodConfig });
// Point to custom configuration for algod, indexer and kmd
const algorand = algokit.AlgorandClient.fromConfig({
  algodConfig,
  indexerConfig,
  kmdConfig,
});
```

## Types

If you want to extend or pass around any of the types the various functions take then they are all defined in isolated modules under the `types` namespace. This is to provide a better intellisense experience without overwhelming you with hundreds of types. If you determine a type to import then you can import it like so:

```typescript
import {<type>} from '@algorandfoundation/types/<module>'
```

Where `<type>` would be replaced with the type and `<module>` would be replaced with the module. You can use intellisense to discover the modules and types in your favourite IDE, or you can explore the [types modules in the reference documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/README.md#modules).

## Config and logging

To configure the AlgoKit Utils library you can make use of the `algokit.Config` object, which has a `configure` method that lets you configure some or all of the configuration options.

## Logging

AlgoKit has an in-built logging abstraction that allows the library to issue log messages without coupling the library to a particular logging library. This means you can access the AlgoKit Utils logs within your existing logging library if you have one.

To do this you need to create a logging translator that exposes the following interface ([`Logger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#logger)):

<Code code={importedCodeLogger} lang='ts' title='Typescript' />
:::note this interface type is directly compatible with [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
so you should be able to pass AlgoKit a Winston logger. :::

By default, the [`consoleLogger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#consolelogger) is set as the logger, which will send log messages to the various `console.*` methods for all logs apart from verbose logs. There is also a [`nullLogger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#nulllogger) if you want to disable logging, or various leveled console loggers: [`verboseConsoleLogger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#verboseconsolelogger) (also outputs verbose logs), [`infoConsoleLogger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#infoconsolelogger) (only outputs info, warning and error logs), [`warningConsoleLogger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/types_logging.md#warningconsolelogger) (only outputs warning and error logs).

If you want to override the logger you can use the following:

```typescript
algokit.configure({ logger: myLogger });
```

To retrieve the current debug state you can use [`algokit.Config.logger`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/interfaces/types_config.Config.md). To get a logger that is optionally set to the null logger based on a boolean flag you can use the [`algokit.Config.getLogger(useNullLogger)`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/classes/types_config.UpdatableConfig.md#getlogger) function.

## Debug mode

To turn on debug mode you can use the following:

```typescript
algokit.configure({ debug: true });
```

To retrieve the current debug state you can use [`algokit.Config.debug`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/interfaces/types_config.Config.md).

This will turn on things like automatic tracing, more verbose logging and [advanced debugging](/build/algokit/utils/ts/debugging.md). It's likely this option will result in extra HTTP calls to algod so worth being careful when it's turned on.

If you want to temporarily turn it on you can use the [`withDebug`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/classes/types_config.UpdatableConfig.md#withdebug) function:

```typescript
algokit.Config.withDebug(() => {
  // Do stuff with algokit.Config.debug set to true
});
```

## Testing

AlgoKit Utils contains a module that helps you write automated tests against an Algorand network (usually LocalNet). These tests can run locally on a developer's machine, or on a Continuous Integration server.

To use the automated testing functionality, you can import the testing module:

```typescript
import * as algotesting from '@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils/testing';
```

Or, you can generally get away with just importing the `algorandFixture` since it exposes the rest of the functionality in a manner that is easy to integrate with an underlying test framework like Jest or vitest:

```typescript
import { algorandFixture } from '@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils/testing';
```

To see how to use it consult the [testing capability page](/build/algokit/utils/ts/testing) or to see what's available look at the [reference documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/modules/testing.md).
