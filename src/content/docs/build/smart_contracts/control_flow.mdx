## Algorand Python Control Flow

Control flow in Algorand Python is similar to standard Python control flow, with support for if statements, while loops, for loops, and match statements.

### If statements

If statements work the same as Python. The conditions must be an expression that evaluates to bool, which can include a [String or Uint64](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/lg-types.html) among others.

```python
if condition:
    # block of code to execute if condition is True
elif condition2:
    # block of code to execute if condition is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # block of code to execute if condition and condition2 are both False
```

[See full example](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/blob/main/test_cases/simplish/contract.py).

### Ternary conditions

Ternary conditions work the same as Python. The condition must be an expression that evaluates to bool, which can include a [String or Uint64](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/lg-types.html) among others.

```python
value1 = UInt64(5)
value2 = String(">6") if value1 > 6 else String("<=6")
```

### While loops

While loops work the same as Python. The condition must be an expression that evaluates to bool, which can include a [String or Uint64](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/lg-types.html) among others.

You can use `break` and `continue`.

```python
while condition:
    # block of code to execute if condition is True
```

Note: we don't currently have support for while-else statements.

[See full example](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/blob/main/test_cases/unssa/contract.py#L32-L83).

### For Loops

For loops are used to iterate over sequences, ranges and [ARC-4 arrays](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/lg-arc4.html). They work the same as Python.

Algorand Python provides functions like `uenumerate` and `urange` to facilitate creating sequences and ranges; in-built Python `reversed` method works with these.

- `uenumerate` is similar to Python's built-in enumerate function, but for UInt64 numbers; it allows you to loop over a sequence and have an automatic counter.
- `urange` is a function that generates a sequence of Uint64 numbers, which you can iterate over.
- `reversed` returns a reversed iterator of a sequence.

Here is an example of how you can use these functions in a contract:

```python
test_array = arc4.StaticArray(arc4.UInt8(), arc4.UInt8(), arc4.UInt8(), arc4.UInt8())

# urange: reversed items, forward index

for index, item in uenumerate(reversed(urange(4))):
    test_array[index] = arc4.UInt8(item)

assert test_array.bytes == Bytes.from_hex("03020100")
```

Note: we don't currently have support for for-else statements.

[See full](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/blob/main/test_cases/reversed_iteration/contract.py) [examples](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/blob/main/test_cases/nested_loops/contract.py).

### Match Statements

Match statements work the same as Python and work for [...]

```python
match value:
    case pattern1:
        # block of code to execute if pattern1 matches
    case pattern2:
        # block of code to execute if pattern2 matches
    case _:
        # Fallback
```

Note: Captures and patterns are not supported. Currently, there is only support for basic case/switch functionality; pattern matching and guard clauses are not currently supported.

[See full example](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/blob/main/test_cases/match/contract.py).

## TEAL Flow Control Opcode

Algorand Python and TypeScript are high-level smart contract languages that allow developers to express control flows in more accessible languages. However, the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) executes the Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL) flow control opcodes after compilation. TEAL is a low-level assembly language that the AVM understands directly. While developers will write smart contracts in higher-level languages, understanding the underlying TEAL opcodes can be beneficial to comprehend what's happening line by line. The following chart contains all of the control flow opcodes available in TEAL.
