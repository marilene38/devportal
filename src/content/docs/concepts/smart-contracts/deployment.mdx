title: Deployment

## Overview

- Definition: Deploying a smart contract on Algorand involves uploading compiled TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language) code to the blockchain, enabling decentralized applications to execute predefined logic.
- Purpose: Deployment makes the smart contract accessible on the Algorand network, allowing users and applications to interact with it.

## Key Concepts in Deployment

- TEAL Compilation: Smart contracts are written in high-level languages like PyTeal and then compiled into TEAL bytecode for execution on the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM).

## Updatable vs. Non-Updatable Contracts

- Updatable Contracts:
- Can be modified after deployment.
- Provide flexibility to fix bugs or add features.
- Configuration: Set the OnUpdate property to allow updates.
- Non-Updatable Contracts:
- Immutable once deployed.
- Enhance security by preventing unauthorized changes.
- Configuration: Set the OnUpdate property to disallow updates.

## Deletable vs. Non-Deletable Contracts

- Deletable Contracts:
  - Can be removed from the blockchain.
  - Useful for temporary applications or testing.
  - Configuration: Set the OnDelete property to allow deletion.
- Non-Deletable Contracts:
  - Permanent on the blockchain.
  - Ensure continuous availability.
  - Configuration: Set the OnDelete property to disallow deletion.

## Understanding Idempotent Deployment

- Definition: Deploying a contract multiple times without changing the outcome.
- Benefits:
  - Prevents duplicate deployments.
  - Ensures consistency across environments.
- Implementation:
  - Use deployment tools that check for existing contracts before deploying new instances.
  - Maintain versioning to track contract changes.

## Automating Deployment with CI/CD

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
  - Automates testing and deployment processes.
  - Ensures code quality and reduces manual errors.
- Best Practices:
  - Integrate deployment scripts into CI/CD pipelines.
  - Use tools like AlgoKit's Deploy feature for seamless deployments.
  - Implement automated tests to validate contract behavior before deployment.

## Secret Management and Security Best Practices

- Handling Sensitive Data:
- Store private keys and credentials securely using environment variables or secret management tools.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your codebase.
- Access Control:
- Restrict permissions to update or delete contracts to authorized accounts.
- Regularly review and update access controls to maintain security.
- Security Audits:
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Consider third-party audits for critical contracts.
