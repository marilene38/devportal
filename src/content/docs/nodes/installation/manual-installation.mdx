This guide shows how to install and run an Algorand node on your system. It covers installation
methods for both Linux distributions and MacOS, with Linux users having the option of package
manager or updater script installation.

## Installation Methods

There are two different methods for installing Algorand nodes depending on your operating system.
Choose the approach that works for your platform and preferences.

<Aside type='caution'>
  Choose one installation method and stick with it. Mixing methods can lead to complex
  troubleshooting issues. If the package manager method is available for your Linux system, it is
  strongly recommended over the updater script method.
</Aside>

### Package Manager Method

_Supported on Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and Red Hat-based (Fedora, CentOS) distributions._

Recommended for users on supported Linux distributions. This method provides automated updates, a
fixed directory structure, and a pre-configured system service, simplifying maintenance.

### Updater Script Method

_Supported on Linux distributions and MacOS._

Required for MacOS users and supported for all Linux distributions. This method allows customizable
data directory location. However, it uses a manual update process. It works with MacOS and all Linux
distributions, including openSUSE Leap, Manjaro, Mageia, Alpine, and Solus.

## Alternative Options

### Docker

Official Docker images are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/algorand/algod).

### Windows

You can build native binaries using Rand Labs’
[repository](https://github.com/randlabs/algorand-windows-node) or use a third-party tool like
[FUNC](https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func).

### Development

If you need a private network for development, consider using
[AlgoKit](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/algokit/) for a simpler setup. Even
without running a node, installing Algorand software provides access to essential developer tools
such as `msgpacktool` and `algokey`, along with other development utilities.

## Hardware Requirements

### Participation Nodes

Participation nodes are actively involved in the Algorand consensus protocol by proposing and voting
on blocks. They require higher network bandwidth to communicate with other nodes efficiently.

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
- 1 Gbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

### Non-Participation Nodes

Non-participation nodes maintain a current copy of the blockchain but do not participate in
consensus, so the hardware requirements are somewhat lower than for participation nodes.
Non-participating nodes are useful for API endpoints and development environments.

- 8 vCPU
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
- 100Mbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

### Archival Nodes

Archival nodes store the entire history of the blockchain from genesis, making them valuable for
applications requiring historical data access. They need significantly more storage than other node
types.

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GB RAM
- Storage:
  - 3 TB SSD for blocks and catchpoints
    ([ColdDataDir](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/config/#algod-configuration-settings))
  - 100 GB NVMe SSD for accounts
    ([HotDataDir](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/config/#algod-configuration-settings))
- 5 TB/month egress
- 1 Gbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

> **Info**: While directly-attached NVMe SSDs are recommended, AWS EBS gp3 volumes have proven
> sufficient as of October 2022. Monitor performance closely and be prepared to upgrade if TPS
> increases significantly.

## Package Manager Installation

The package manager installs Algorand node software in the standard system locations:

- Binary files: `/usr/bin`
- Data directory: `/var/lib/algorand`
- KMD files: `${HOME}/.algorand/kmd-version`

See [Node Artifacts](/nodes/reference/artifacts) for a complete list of installed files.

<Aside type='note'>
  The Key Manager Daemon (KMD) is Algorand's wallet process that manages keys and signing
  operations. It is used for wallet operations through the SDKs and REST API.
</Aside>

It is recommended to configure the environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc`):

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
export ALGORAND_DATA=/var/lib/algorand
```

This sets a permanent environment variable that tells Algorand tools where to find your node's data
directory, eliminating the need to specify it with the `-d` flag in every command.

### Installation

#### For Debian-Based Systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint)

<Steps>

1. First, update your system and install required packages:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl software-properties-common
   ```

2. Add Algorand’s repository and security key:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   curl -o - https://releases.algorand.com/key.pub | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/algorand.asc
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://releases.algorand.com/deb/ stable main"
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

3. Install Algorand (choose one option):

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   # Option A: Install Algorand with developer tools
   sudo apt-get install -y algorand-devtools

   # Option B: Install only Algorand node
   sudo apt-get install -y algorand
   ```

</Steps>

#### For Red Hat-Based Systems (Fedora, CentOS)

##### CentOS 7

<Steps>

1. Import Algorand’s repository key and set up the repository:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/rpm_algorand.pub
   sudo rpmkeys --import rpm_algorand.pub
   sudo yum install yum-utils
   sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo
   ```

2. Install Algorand (choose one option):

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   # Option A: Install Algorand with developer tools
   sudo yum install algorand-devtools

   # Option B: Install only Algorand node
   sudo yum install algorand
   ```

</Steps>

##### Fedora or CentOS 8 Stream

<Steps>

1. Import Algorand’s repository key and set up the repository:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/rpm_algorand.pub
   sudo rpmkeys --import rpm_algorand.pub
   dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
   dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo
   ```

2. Install Algorand:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   dnf install algorand
   ```

</Steps>

### Post-Installation Notes

After installation, Algorand is configured as a system service and starts automatically on MainNet.
See [switching networks](/nodes/management/switch-networks) for details on changing to another
network.

All core binaries are installed in `/usr/bin`, so you can run `algod` and `goal` commands from any
directory. Your node's data will be stored in `/var/lib/algorand`.

Since the data directory `/var/lib/algorand` is owned by the user `algorand` and the daemon `algod`
is run as the user `algorand`, operations related to wallets and accounts (`goal account ...` and
`goal wallet ...`) need to be run as the user `algorand`. For example, to list participation keys,
use:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# If $ALGORAND_DATA is set:
sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkeys

# If $ALGORAND_DATA is not set:
sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkeys -d /var/lib/algorand
```

<Aside type='caution'>
  Never run `goal` as root (using `sudo` directly). This can compromise file permissions in
  `/var/lib/algorand`.
</Aside>

Additional tools are available through separate packages:

- Developer utilities through the `algorand-devtools` package
- Extra tools like `pingpong` in the `tools_stable_linux-amd64_2.1.6.tar.gz` package

### Installing the Developer Tools

The `algorand-devtools` package (introduced in version 2.1.5) provides additional developer
utilities:

- `carpenter`
- `catchupsrv`
- `msgpacktool`
- `tealcut`
- `tealdbg`

Installation is straightforward using your system's package manager (`apt` or `yum`). The package
manager will handle dependencies automatically:

- If Algorand is not installed, it will be installed automatically
- If Algorand is already installed, it will be updated if needed

See the
[installation instructions](/nodes/installation/manual-installation#for-debian-based-systems-ubuntu-linux-mint)
above for detailed installation commands.

### Managing Your Node

The node starts automatically after package manager installation. To control the node manually, use
the following commands:

To start your node:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
sudo systemctl start algorand
```

To stop your node:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
sudo systemctl stop algorand
```

To check your node's status:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
goal node status -d /var/lib/algorand
```

## Updater Script Installation

The updater script installation requires two main directories:

- Binary directory (recommended: `~/node`) - Contains Algorand executables
- Data directory (recommended: `~/node/data`) - Stores blockchain and node data

When updating, the script archives your existing installation before overwriting the binaries.
Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
```

These settings tell Algorand tools where to find your data directory and make `goal` commands
directly executable.

### MacOS Installation

Verified on OSX v12.3.1 (Monterey).

<Steps>

1. Create and enter the installation directory:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   mkdir ~/node
   cd ~/node
   ```

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   mkdir ~/node
   cd ~/node
   ```

2. Download and prepare the updater script:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh -O
   chmod 744 update.sh
   ```

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh -O
   chmod 744 update.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   ./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
   ```

   For beta releases, use `-c beta` instead of `-c stable`.

   The installer will download and install the latest package from S3. The `-n` flag prevents
   automatic node startup. All binaries, including developer tools, are included in this
   installation.

4. Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   These environment variables help you run `goal` commands without specifying the data directory
   each time.

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
   export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
   ```

</Steps>

### Linux Installation

Verified on Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE Leap, Manjaro, Mageia, Alpine, and Solus. Other modern
Linux distributions should work as well.

<Steps>

1. Create and enter the installation directory:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   mkdir ~/node
   cd ~/node
   ```

2. Download and prepare the updater script:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh
   chmod 744 update.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   ./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
   ```

   The installer will download and install the latest package from S3. The `-n` flag prevents
   automatic node startup. All binaries, including developer tools, are included in this
   installation.

4. Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
   export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
   ```

   These environment variables help you run `goal` commands without specifying the data directory
   each time.

</Steps>

### Post-Installation Notes

After installation, your node must be started manually. Your data will be stored in the directory
you specified during installation (recommended: `~/node/data`).

Unlike package manager installations where binaries are in `/usr/bin`, your binaries will be in your
specified installation directory (recommended: `~/node`). Make sure you've set up your environment
variables as instructed above to run commands from any directory.

The installation includes all binaries, including developer tools - there is no separate devtools
package. This differs from package manager installations which separate these packages.

### Managing Your Node

Unlike package manager installations, nodes installed via the updater script must be started
manually. To control the node manually, use the following commands:

To start your node:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
goal node start
```

To stop your node:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
goal node stop
```

To verify your node is running:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
pgrep algod
```

### Setting Up systemd Service

When installing using the updater script, several shell scripts are bundled in the tarball to help
with running `algod`. One of these is the `systemd-setup.sh` script to create a system service.

Usage: `./systemd-setup.sh username group [bindir]`

#### Installation

<Steps>

1. Create the service with root privileges:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo ./systemd-setup.sh algorand algorand
   ```

   This creates `/lib/systemd/system/algorand@.service` using the included template
   (`algorand@.service.template`). The template file includes helpful information at its top and is
   worth reviewing.

2. Specify binary location (optional):

   ```ini
   [Service]
   ExecStart=@@BINDIR@@/algod -d %I
   User=@@USER@@
   Group=@@GROUP@@
   ```

   The service template above shows how `systemd` locates your `algod` binary. By default, it uses
   the current working directory, but you can specify a different location using the `bindir`
   parameter, which must be an absolute path:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo ./systemd-setup.sh algorand algorand /path/to/binary/directory
   ```

3. Register the service:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

   This command makes `systemd` aware that the service is present on the system. You should also run
   this command if you make any changes to the service after installation.

4. Start the service:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo systemctl start algorand@$(systemd-escape $ALGORAND_DATA)
   ```

   This command starts the Algorand service using your data directory path (specified by
   `$ALGORAND_DATA`). The `systemd-escape` command formats the path to be compatible with systemd.

   To configure the service to start automatically when your system boots:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   sudo systemctl enable algorand@$(systemd-escape $ALGORAND_DATA)
   ```

</Steps>

## Synchronizing Your Node

After starting your node for the first time, it needs to synchronize with the network by downloading
and validating the blockchain. There are two methods for this:

### Standard Synchronization

When using standard synchronization, your node downloads and validates every block since genesis.
This process can take several hours or even days, depending on your hardware and network connection.

To check your node's sync status:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
goal node status
```

A fully synchronized node will show a "Sync Time" of 0.0s, like this:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
Last committed block: 125064
Time since last block: 3.1s
Sync Time: 0.0s
Last consensus protocol: https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/tree/5615adc36bad610c7f165fa2967f4ecfa75125f0
Next consensus protocol: https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/tree/5615adc36bad610c7f165fa2967f4ecfa75125f0
Round for next consensus protocol: 125065
Next consensus protocol supported: true
Genesis ID: testnet-v1.0
Genesis hash: SGO1GKSzyE7IEPItTxCByw9x8FmnrCDexi9/cOUJOiI=
```

### Fast Catchup

Fast catchup significantly accelerates the synchronization process by using catchpoint snapshots.
Instead of processing every block, your node downloads a recent snapshot of the blockchain state and
then synchronizes only the most recent blocks.

However, keep in mind that fast catchup requires trusting the entity providing the catchpoint. For
maximum security, either use a catchpoint from your own archival node or synchronize from genesis.

<Aside type='caution'>
  Do not use fast catchup on archival or relay nodes. If you accidentally do so, you must reset your
  node and start from scratch.
</Aside>

#### Latest Catchpoints

Get the most recent catchpoint for your network:

- [MainNet Catchpoint](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/mainnet/latest.catchpoint)
- [TestNet Catchpoint](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/testnet/latest.catchpoint)
- [BetaNet Catchpoint](https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/betanet/latest.catchpoint)

#### Fast Catchup Process

<Steps>

1. Start your node if it isn't running:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   goal node start
   ```

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   goal node start
   ```

2. Use the catchup command with your network's current catchpoint from from the catchpoint URL:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   goal node catchup 4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA
   ```

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   goal node catchup 4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA
   ```

3. Check your node's sync status:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   goal node status -w 1000
   ```

   The `-w` flag updates the status every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Press Ctrl/Cmd+C to stop
   monitoring. During catchup, you'll see additional status lines showing progress:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   Catchpoint: 4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA
   Catchpoint total accounts: 1146
   Catchpoint accounts processed: 1146
   Catchpoint total blocks: 1000
   Catchpoint downloaded blocks: 81
   ```

   Your node is fully synchronized when these catchpoint lines disappear and "Sync Time" shows 0.0s.

</Steps>

#### Troubleshooting Fast Catchup

If fast catchup fails, verify:

- Your node is not configured as archival or relay
- You're running the latest Algorand software (goal version -v)
- The catchpoint matches your network's Genesis ID
- Your hardware meets the requirements
- Your system has sufficient memory
- You're using an SSD (not HDD) for storage

If you accidentally used fast catchup on an archival node:

<Steps>

1. Stop the node

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
     goal node stop
   ```

2. Remove all files in the data directory except:

   - Configuration files (\*.json)
   - Genesis files (genesis\*)

3. Restart the node

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
     goal node start
   ```

</Steps>

## Enabling Telemetry

Algorand nodes include telemetry instrumentation that can provide insights into the software's
performance and usage. This data helps Algorand Inc. improve the software and identify issues.
Telemetry is disabled by default - no data will be shared unless you explicitly enable it.

### Managing Telemetry

#### Enable Telemetry

You can enable telemetry with or without a custom hostname. Using a custom hostname helps identify
your node in telemetry data.

To enable with a custom hostname:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# For updater script installations:
diagcfg telemetry name -n <hostname>

# For package manager installations:
sudo -u algorand -H -E diagcfg telemetry name -n <hostname>
```

Replace `<hostname>` with your desired identifier (e.g., 'MainNetRelay1' or 'TestNetNode2').

To enable without a custom hostname:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# For updater script installations:
diagcfg telemetry enable

# For package manager installations:
sudo -u algorand -H -E diagcfg telemetry enable
```

<Aside type='note'>
  After enabling or disabling telemetry, restart your node for changes to take effect.
</Aside>

#### Disable Telemetry

To disable telemetry:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# For updater script installations:
diagcfg telemetry disable

# For package manager installations:
sudo -u algorand -H -E diagcfg telemetry disable
```

### Verifying Telemetry Status

#### Check Configuration

To verify your telemetry settings:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# For updater script installations:
diagcfg telemetry

# For package manager installations:
sudo -u algorand -H -E diagcfg telemetry
```

#### Check Connection

To verify if your node is connected to the telemetry server:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
sudo netstat -an | grep :9243
```

If telemetry is enabled and working, you'll see output like:

```text
tcp        0      0 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyyy        18.214.74.184:9243      ESTABLISHED
```

If telemetry is disabled or not working, this command will produce no output.

### Technical Details

- Telemetry configuration is stored in `~/.algorand/logging.config` (or `data/logging.config` if
  `-d data` was specified)
- For package manager installations, always run telemetry commands as the `algorand` user with
  `-H -E` flags
- Never run telemetry commands as root (don't use `sudo` directly with `diagcfg`)
- The `-H` flag ensures the correct home directory is used for the `algorand` user

<Aside type='caution'>
  Running `diagcfg` as root will only affect nodes run as root, which is not recommended for
  security reasons.
</Aside>

### Third-Party Telemetry Services

#### Nodely Telemetry Service

In addition to Algorand's default telemetry service, you can send your node's telemetry data to
Nodely's free third-party service. Nodely provides additional features including:

- Health scoring based on multiple metrics
- Voting performance monitoring
- Network performance analytics
- Synchronization monitoring
- Public leaderboards
- Global node comparison dashboard

For more details about Nodely's telemetry service, see their
[telemetry documentation](https://nodely.io/docs/telemetry/quickstart/).

<Aside type='note'>
  Nodely's telemetry service is designed for MainNet nodes including validators, API nodes, and P2P
  nodes/relays. Do not use it for the Relay/Archiver Running Program.
